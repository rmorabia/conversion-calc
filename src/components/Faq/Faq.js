        </p>
        <p>
          Great question, they're the same weight! One pound of feathers is
          equal to one pound of bricks, but the volume of 1 pound of feathers is
          greater than the volume of 1 pound of bricks.

          <i>2. What measurements do you support?</i>
        </p>
        <p>Currently, we support grams, cups, tablespoons, teaspoons.</p>

            3. Is it better to measure by volume (ie. cups) or weight (ie.
            grams)?
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because baking requires sharp precision, it's better to measure by
          weight.
